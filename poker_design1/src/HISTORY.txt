20 Oct 1998, v1.1.5:
  - Yet another bug, this time STRAIGHTFLUSH hadn't been fixed when
    STRAIGHT was. Stupid, and done better this time.
  - Rounding error in payoff() could lead to infinite loop.
  - Busted players were getting money from tie payoffs.

26 Oct 1998, v1.1.4:
  - Error in payoff() was distributing nothing when breaking ties.

23 Oct 1998, v1.1.3:
  - Yet another bug in "STRAIGHT A" handling. Looks right now...

23 Oct 1998, v1.1.2:
  - Handle case where "callee" has folded (e.g. if everyone else has
    checked around since he folded).

h22 Oct 1998, v1.1.1:
  - HoldemPokerPlayer would CALL when it needs to TAPOUT. Stupid error
    made when adding multiple behaviours to the player.

19 Oct 1998, v1.1.0:
  - Added protocol handling for additional ranks needed to break ties
    in FOUROFAKIND, FULLHOUSE, and THREEOFAKIND, since these hands can
    in fact tie in games with common cards. Affects HandType classes
    and the HandTypeSelector used in the Player.

13 Oct 1998, v1.0.1:
  - Fixed bug in STRAIGHT testing and creation.

12 Oct 1998, v1.0:
  - Initial URCS release
