<H1>Running a Poker Game Using IPP Tools</H1>
<P>
This document describes how to use the Internet Poker Protocol (IPP)
tools to run a game.
<P>
<H2>Start the server</H2>

IPP services are provided by the IPP server, <TT>ippd</TT>. During a
tournament, we will look after starting a server for the tournament.
However, during testing you need to start your own server every time
you want to play a game. The server only manages one game at a time,
and only plays one game per game.
<P>
To start the server, you run the program:
<PRE>
      /u/cs400/poker/bin/ippd
</PRE>
By default, the server will listen for new connections on port 9898.
Since only one program can listen on a TCP port at one time, you will
probably need to use a different port number for your testing. I
suggest that if you are in group <B>N</B> for (<B>N</B> from 1 to 4),
you use port 9898+<B>N</B>. You pass this port number to <TT>ippd</TT>
using the <TT>-port</TT> option, as in:
<PRE>
      /u/cs400/poker/bin/ippd -port 9899
</PRE>
<P>
If you are running several programs with windows, you might find the
``<TT>-size small</TT>'' option useful to fit them all on your screen.
For more information and options, see <A HREF="ippd.txt">the
<TT>ippd</TT> manpage</A>.

<H2>Start some clients</H2>

With the server running, it is now waiting for clients to connect.
These clients can include any combination of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Your poker-playing program. Of course, this is the client with
which you should be most concerned.
<LI>We have provided simple clients written in several different
languages (Perl, C, C++, Java, and Lisp). These let you see the server's
messages and respond by typing back to the server. The sources to
these programs are available and can serve as (part of) the foundation
of your own client.
<LI>We have also developed two clients for use in tournaments, one
that plays by itself (<TT>ippplayer</TT>) and one that lets people
play (<TT>ipphuman</TT>). These clients may be useful for running test
games, but their source is not available and you shouldn't try to use
them other than as competition.
</UL>
<P>
During a tournament, you will start your client and connect to the main
server. During testing, you will need to start several different
clients (including your own) and connect them to the server you
started above.
<P>
In what follows, we will assume you are running several copies of
<TT>ippplayer</TT>. Typically you would fire up a few <TT>xterm</TT>'s
and start a client in each window. The procedure for running the
clients differs slightly depending on whether the clients are on the
same machine as the server or not (and you should support similar
flexibility in your client).
<P>
To start the automatic player (the human player interface is similar),
you need to specify the player's name and their buyin amount on the
command-line, as in:
<PRE>
      /u/cs400/poker/bin/ippplayer George 1000
</PRE>
If your server is not running on the default port (as described
above), you need to tell the client at which TCP port to contact the
server using the <TT>-server</TT> option, as in:
<PRE>
      /u/cs400/poker/bin/ippplayer -server localhost:9899 George 1000
</PRE>
If furthermore your server is running on a different machine that the
client, you need to specify the hostname in the <TT>-server</TT>
option, as in:
<PRE>
      /u/cs400/poker/bin/ippplayer -server micro:9899 George 1000
</PRE>
<P>
As with <TT>ippd</TT>, the clients support the ``<TT>-size
small</TT>'' option if you want to try to fit more of them on the
screen. See the manpages for <A
HREF="ippplayer.txt"><TT>ippplayer</TT></A> and <A
HREF="ipphuman.txt"><TT>ipphuman</TT></A> for more options.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> The IPP server prints all message traffic to
standard output. If you want to save this for future debugging,
do something like
<PRE>
      /u/cs400/poker/bin/ippplayer ...args... | tee ippd.log
</PRE>
The <TT>tee</TT> program copies its standard input to both standard
output and to the given file. Very handy. Leave standard error
unpiped to make sure you see error messages from the server.

<H2>Start the game</H2>

Once your clients have connected (you can see them on the server's
display and in the messages printed by the server to standard output),
start the game by pressing the ``Start'' button. This will announce
the set of players to all the clients and start the first hand (with
the <B>BUTTON</B> message, then the <B>ANTE</B>, and so on).

<H2>Ending the game</H2>

There is no elegant way to terminate the server. Just kill it by
typing Control-C in its window. All clients should also terminate,
except for clients that are blocked waiting for input. These will have
to be killed by hand.
<P>
Be sure to not leave the server running or you will be unable to
reallocate the port the next time you try to start the server.
