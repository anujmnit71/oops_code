     ipphuman - Internet Poker Protocol human client

SYNOPSIS
     ipphuman [-server HOST:PORT] [-size large|small] NAME [BUYIN]

DESCRIPTION
     This program launches an automated Internet  Poker  Protocol
     (IPP)  client for use by a human player. The client connects
     to the IPP server, identifies itself as NAME, and then plays
     in the game. When action is needed, the human player can use
     graphical buttons and dialog boxes to indicate  his  or  her
     play.

OPTIONS
     -server HOST:PORT
          Specifies the TCP port on which to contact the  server.
          The default is localhost:9898.

     -size large|small
          Specifies the size of the graphical display, if one  is
          enabled.  The  large  display  is  more  readable,  but
          several small displays will fit on a single workstation
          screen.
