/**
 * An API for a queue that is intended to be used as a local
 * buffer for data before it is sent to remote systems. <br/><br/>
 *
 * Publishing and consumption must be completely thread-safe. <br/><br/>
 *
 * Each entry in a <code>BufferQueue</code> is represented by
 * a {@link BufferQueueEntry}. <br/><br/>
 *
 * Enqueuing/publishing data to the queue is a 3-step process:
 * <ol>
 *      <li>"Claim" a new entry using the method {@link #next()}</li>
 *      <li>Write the data to the returned {@link BufferQueueEntry} using any method that it offers</li>
 *      <li>Mark the entry as published by calling {@link BufferQueueEntry#markPublished()}</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Alternatively, calling {@link #publish(byte[] data)} will
 * internally do all these steps automatically. <br/><br/>
 *
 * Multiple {@link #next()}/{@link #publish(byte[] data)} calls could
 * be happening in parallel and entries must be made available for consumption
 * in the order in which they were claimed. <br/><br/>
 *
 * Dequeueing/consuming data from the queue is also a 3-step process:
 * <ol>
 *      <li>Get the next entry to be consumed from the queue by calling {@link #consume()}</li>
 *      <li>Read and consume the data from the returned {@link BufferQueueEntry}</li>
 *      <li>Mark the entry as consumed by calling {@link BufferQueueEntry#markConsumed()}</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Consumption using the above process will be ordered -- messages will be
 * consumed in the same order in which they were claimed/published. Until a message is
 * marked as consumed, the next message will not be returned. Thus it does not
 * make sense to consume in parallel -- the same entry will be delivered to multiple
 * queues. <br/><br/>
 *
 * There is also a batch consume API in the form of the method {@link #consume(int n)}
 * that allows consumption of multiple entries (up to <code>n</code>) at the same time.
 * This can also be used to parallelize consumption -- get a batch of entries and then
 * hand them off to a separate set of worker threads to process. Please note that this
 * would imply that entries would be processed out-of-order. <br/>
 *
 * @see com.flipkart.iris.bufferqueue.BufferQueueEntry
